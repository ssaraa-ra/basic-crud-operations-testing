# Basic PHP CRUD Example

A simple PHP & MySQL project to demonstrate basic **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  
I made this as a beginner-friendly example for those learning how to handle basic database operations in PHP.

The code isn’t advanced — it’s just a **starting point to practice adding, editing, and deleting data in a database**.
